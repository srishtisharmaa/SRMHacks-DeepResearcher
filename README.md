# SRMHacks-DeepResearcher

This project showcases a unique approach to data synthesis and analysis. Our agent's core innovation lies in its ability to conduct intelligent research using a fully local, API-free architecture. By generating and processing custom embeddings and performing complex, multi-step reasoning, it efficiently extracts and synthesizes relevant information from large-scale data sources, delivering a powerful alternative to traditional search methods. This demonstrates a strong command of modern AI principles and a focus on building a secure, self-contained solution.
